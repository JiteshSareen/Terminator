# Terminator

This was the first repository created by me when I tried GitHub for the very first time. I still can't remember the reason of naming it as Terminator. But since I have named it so, I will populate the repository with some Terminator related stuff/cool project(if I could come up with) in the next few months. 

Or wait... Can this repository be the starting of the **SKYNET**.... Ummm.. who knows?? Let's just hope that Arnold Schwarzenegger(had to Google the name for spelling) does not come to kill me. Or someone from the future... 

Till then ...
